Hi, I am Nandini Ramachandran and am currently enrolled in the spring cohort of the Metis Data Science Bootcamp in San Francisco. I am an aspiring Data Scientist who is just getting my hands dirty with manipulating and analyzing data. I have a quantitative background and am currently employed as a Research Engineer for a startup which specializes in Model Predictive Applications. I hope to become an expert in Data Science and be employed as a full time Data Scientist upon completion of the Bootcamp!

### More Information

A little bit more about my background- I am originally from India and I completed my undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering. I completed my masters degree from CMU, where I specialized in Process Systems Engineering. My masters thesis was on Model prediction for Open Loop and Closed loop data. After graduation, I have been working on a research based assignment with a startup on software development for model predictive applications in collaboration with ExxonMobil. I have a lot of hands-on experience working with data and hope to become a data scientist in the near future!
